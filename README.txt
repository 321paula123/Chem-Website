This project was designed in collaboration with Steven Calle and Anushka Prativadhi. 
The code was written by myself, Paula Young.

This website showcases UX design principles.
The user can select varying combinations of learning styles, and the content of the website changes accordingly.
Not all aspects of the website are functional (only two chapter sections have content, and the search bar is a placeholder, as is the 'translate' button).
